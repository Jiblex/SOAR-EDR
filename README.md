# SOAR-EDR

## Overview
This project aims to integrate Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities to streamline and automate incident response processes. The core of this project is built around leveraging LimaCharlie for endpoint detection and custom rule creation, coupled with Tines for orchestrating automated responses and user notifications.

### LimaCharlie
LimaCharlie is the EDR tool which is used for detecting incidents based on custom rules intended to detect potential threats or suspicious activity at endpoint. LimaCharlie provides the necessary visibility into any endpoint connected to it, providing alerts once detection rules have been triggered.
